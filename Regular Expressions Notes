Regular Expressions - are find and replace on steroids

# Use of literal searches

- "escape" a metacharcter with a slash

## Wildcards

- any character or space other than an end-of-line

- `\w` a single word character (letter, number, or an _)
- `\d` is a single number character
- `\t` a single tab space
- `\s` a single space, tab, or line break
- `\n` a single line break (or `\r`)

## Quantifiers
- `\w+` one or more consecturive word characters
- `\w*` zero or more consecturive word characters
- `\w{3}` exactly 3 consecutive characters
- `\w{3,}` find 3 or more consecutive word characters
- `\w{3,5}` find 3,4,5 or more consecutive word characters

### Using a zero or more* quantifier

#### Using `.*` for "all the rest" in a line

#### Use () to "capture elements of the text for replacement

#### Specify consecutive capture elements with `\1,\2,` etc in the prelacement string

#### in replacement string, mix captured text with literal text

#### Dealing with genus and spcies names

#### Create custom character sets

`\[A,C,T,G] Find a sequence of nucleotides
`\[A,C,T,G]+`Find a string that is NOT a sequence

#### R package`stringr()`
